# KR 6th Expressions Notes

#What is an algorithm? 
    #set of instructions to accomplish a task
    #Expression is a collection of numbers and symbols in order to get a result
    #Going through the exact same steps
name = input("What is your name? ")
print("hello", name)

#algorithm for area
length = 5
width = 20 
area = length * width
print(length, "X", width, "=", area) 
#List steps in an algorithm
    # 1. variables/pieces of info needed
    # 2. process our info
    # 3.provide an output
